# How to build a homelab
Building a homelab can be a fun way to entertain yourself while learning new concepts and experimenting with new technologies.Thanks to the popularity of single-board computers (SBCs), it is easier than ever to build a multi-computer lab right from the comfort of your home. For instance, creating a "private cloud at home" is also a great way to get exposure to cloud-native technologies for considerably less money than trying to replicate the same setup with a major cloud provider.

Do you want to create a homelab? Maybe you want to experiment with different technologies, create development environments, or have your own private cloud. There are many reasons to have a homelab, and this guide aims to make it easier to get started.

There are three categories to consider when planning a home lab: hardware, software, and maintenance. We'll look at the first two categories here and save maintaining your computer lab for a future article.
